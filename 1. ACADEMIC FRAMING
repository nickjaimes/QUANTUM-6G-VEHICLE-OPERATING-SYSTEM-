Toward Quantum-Assisted, 6G-Connected Operating Systems for Intelligent Mobility

Abstract

The increasing complexity of autonomous mobility systems exposes fundamental limitations in deterministic decision-making, centralized computation, and latency-bound communication architectures. This paper proposes a Quantum-6G Vehicle Operating System (Q6G-VOS): a distributed, AI-native operating system that integrates real-time vehicle intelligence, quantum-assisted optimization, and sixth-generation (6G) cognitive networking. Rather than embedding quantum hardware directly into vehicles, the system leverages cloud-accessible quantum computation for probabilistic reasoning under uncertainty, while utilizing 6G networks for ultra-low-latency coordination across vehicles and infrastructure. The proposed architecture emphasizes safety, resilience, and ethical constraint enforcement, particularly under conditions of network degradation, sensor uncertainty, and environmental unpredictability.

1. Introduction

Autonomous vehicles increasingly operate in environments characterized by incomplete information, dynamic hazards, and adversarial conditions such as network jamming, sensor degradation, and infrastructure failure. Conventional vehicle operating systems rely primarily on deterministic algorithms, localized perception, and latency-sensitive communication links. While effective in controlled settings, these approaches struggle to scale under uncertainty.

Recent advances in quantum computing, probabilistic optimization, and AI-native networking suggest an alternative paradigm: distributed cognition across vehicle, edge, and cloud layers. Simultaneously, emerging 6G research envisions networks that integrate communication, sensing, and computation as a unified substrate. This convergence motivates the exploration of a vehicle operating system explicitly designed to reason under uncertainty and operate as part of a planetary-scale intelligence fabric.

2. Background and Motivation

2.1 Limitations of Deterministic Autonomy

Current autonomous driving stacks typically:
   •   Optimize single predicted trajectories,
   •   Depend heavily on GPS and continuous connectivity,
   •   React to hazards rather than evaluating multiple futures.

These assumptions degrade performance in high-entropy environments such as disasters, dense urban systems, or contested network spaces.

2.2 Quantum-Assisted Optimization

Quantum computing demonstrates potential advantages in:
   •   Combinatorial optimization,
   •   Probabilistic sampling,
   •   Multi-solution evaluation under constraints.

While near-term quantum hardware remains unsuitable for onboard deployment, cloud-based quantum resources can already assist decision-making pipelines.

2.3 6G as a Cognitive Network

Unlike prior generations, 6G research emphasizes:
   •   Sub-millisecond latency,
   •   AI-native routing and resource allocation,
   •   Integrated sensing and communication,
   •   Edge–cloud–device computational fusion.

These characteristics align naturally with distributed autonomous systems.

3. System Overview: Quantum-6G Vehicle Operating System (Q6G-VOS)

The proposed Q6G-VOS is a distributed operating system, not a monolithic in-vehicle controller. Its defining property is probabilistic decision support, rather than deterministic rule execution.

Design Assumptions
   •   Vehicles remain safe and operational when disconnected.
   •   Quantum computation is accessed remotely.
   •   Safety constraints supersede optimization objectives.
   •   Network intelligence is treated as part of the OS.

4. Layered Architecture

4.1 Quantum-Aware Hardware Abstraction Layer

Interfaces with sensors, actuators, energy systems, and secure hardware modules, abstracting both classical and emerging quantum-enhanced sensors.

4.2 Multi-Modal Sensor Fusion

Combines heterogeneous sensor data into uncertainty-aware environmental representations, enabling confidence estimation rather than binary perception.

4.3 AI-Native Real-Time Kernel

Executes deterministic, safety-critical control loops with guaranteed timing constraints, independent of external connectivity.

4.4 Quantum Decision Interface

Formulates constrained optimization problems and submits them to quantum or quantum-inspired solvers, receiving probabilistic solution sets rather than single outputs.

4.5 6G Cognitive Network Stack

Provides ultra-low-latency communication, cooperative perception, and distributed situational awareness across vehicles and infrastructure.

4.6 Quantum-Secure Communication Layer

Implements post-quantum cryptography and, where available, quantum key distribution for identity and command integrity.

4.7 Application and Policy Layer

Hosts navigation, autonomy, energy management, emergency response, and human–machine interaction modules governed by explicit policy constraints.

5. Execution Model

The Q6G-VOS operates on a closed-loop cognitive cycle:
Sense → Predict → Simulate Futures → Constrain → Decide → Act → Learn

Quantum-assisted computation is applied exclusively during the Simulate Futures phase, ensuring classical determinism at the actuation level.

6. Quantum-6G SUV as a Reference Platform

To ground the OS concept, a Quantum-6G SUV is proposed as a reference implementation. The vehicle functions as a mobile intelligence node, featuring:
   •   Redundant compute paths,
   •   Sensor-sovereign navigation,
   •   Energy-aware autonomy,
   •   Cooperative swarm behavior.

Importantly, the architecture prioritizes graceful degradation, ensuring safety during partial system failures.

7. Use Cases

Potential applications include:
   •   Disaster response and evacuation,
   •   GPS-denied or network-contested environments,
   •   Cooperative urban mobility,
   •   Civil defense and emergency logistics,
   •   Long-duration autonomous transport.

8. Ethical and Safety Considerations

The system embeds non-negotiable constraints:
   •   Human life preservation,
   •   Conservative uncertainty handling,
   •   Explainable decision-making,
   •   Explicit override and isolation mechanisms.

Optimization objectives are evaluated only within these boundaries.

9. Discussion

The proposed architecture does not claim immediate deployment feasibility but outlines a technically plausible convergence path. As quantum computing, 6G networking, and AI-native systems mature independently, their integration at the operating-system level becomes increasingly inevitable.

⸻

10. Conclusion

This paper presents a neutral, systems-oriented framing of Quantum-6G Vehicle Operating Systems as a response to rising uncertainty in autonomous mobility. By combining quantum-assisted probabilistic reasoning with 6G cognitive networking, Q6G-VOS represents a shift from reactive autonomy toward predictive, safety-first intelligence.
